    <h2>Dickson Mng'ong'o</h2>
    <p>I am currently enrolled in a Bachelors of Applied Technology online degreee program through BYU-I. I intend to build a career as a web developer. I enjoy playing the piano, going out with friends and attending church meetings. I also love working out and staying fit. I am currently involved in an Software developing internship program part-time in Kinondoni Dar es salaam.</p>
    <p>Something that I love about BYU-Idaho is how Gospel principles are incorporated into the learning path of students. From this course I hope to improve my understanding and skills in web design and development.I belive in Jesus Christ he will guide me.</p>
